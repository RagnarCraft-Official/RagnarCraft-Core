Sector: Cygnus X-1 / Collapse Zone.
Status: Critical.
Architect here. The parameters for Batch 1 are locked in. We need to insulate the crew's neural pathways before we initiate the acceleration phase. If the virus breaches the pilot's cortex during the slingshot, we drift into the event horizon.
Here is the schematic for the primary cranial defense unit.
Item Designation: Cortex Shield / Model: VØID-WALKER
Lore Fragment:
"The corruption in the Cygnus sector isn't just code; it’s a psycho-acoustic frequency that bleeds into organic tissue. The VØID-WALKER cap features a woven hyper-conductive mesh lining acting as a localized Faraday cage for the frontal lobe. It filters out the 'screaming' of the dying star systems, ensuring the wearer maintains absolute zero focus during the trajectory calculations. Without it, the static wins."
